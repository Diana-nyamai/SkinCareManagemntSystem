# SkinCareManagementSystem

My final year project was a system that enables users to sign up and access skincare products for purchase. 
It also includes the ability to book appointments with a dermatologist for professional advice and examination.
On the administrative side, the system allows for the upload, editing, and deletion of products in stock as well as the ability to view and update orders and track the number of registered users.
